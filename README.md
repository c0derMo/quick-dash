A small autoit-script which adds some hotkeys to windows.

# Hotkeys
## ALT + {-}
This hotkey shows a small window, which can be used to launch programs or execute cmd commands (without arguments).
The keywords that you can put in can be customised in an ini-file. Type 'ini' to open it.

## CTRL + ALT + F4
This hotkey is an addition to ALT + F4.
It trys to terminate the process of the currently focused window, which means no "Would you like to save?" prompts will appear.
Some programs, games in particular, can't be terminated using this way, because the hotkey is blocked.

## SHIFT + ALT + WIN + s
I wanted to make this hotkey ALTGR + WIN + s, but it ended up with that. This puts your computer to sleep, if you have hibernate disabled, or if it's still enabled puts your PC into hibernate.
